I use all range of frameworks depend on my purpose in various teams. For most of my internal company projects, they don't require heavy lifting frameworks with Node to transpile; such as, Vue, Angular, or React. Having said that, I cannot go back too basic without modern framework, in order to avoid that my team goes into some chaotic situation in the future.

The best part of Riot is, it compiles on the browser while it supports  modern component based UI mechanism with reasonable learning curve. This is very useful for me because I have to split tasks with other team members in different skill levels. This also helps me to avoid confusion for git conflicts.

If you are looking for a solution for public facing app that requires optimal loading, SEO, and majority of browser support, this book is not practical enough for you; however, what I really try to achieve in this book is using RiotJS to teach quite a few universal software engineering concepts when you building software. 

- Component building process
- Decoupling logic and design
- Approch to state management
- Corrabolative project struture for long time support and quick maintenance turn around
