I use all range of frameworks depend on my purpose in various teams. For most of my internal company projects don't require heavy lifting frameworks with Node to transpile; such as, Vue, Angular, or React. Having said that, I cannot go back too basic, e.g. only jQuery, in order to avoid that my team goes into some chaotic situation in the future.

The best part of Riot is that it compiles on the browser, and it supports all modern component based UI mechanism with reasonable learning curve. This is very useful for me because I have to split tasks with other team members in different skill levels and avoid confusion for git conflicts.

If you are looking for a solution for public facing app that requires optimal loading, SEO, and majority of browser support, this book is not practical enough for you; however, what I am really to achieve in this book is using RiotJS to teach quite a few important concept when you building software. 

- Component building process
- Decoupling logic and design
- Approch to state management
- Corrabolative project struture for long time support and quick maintenance turn around
