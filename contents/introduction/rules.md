# Rules

<ol>
    <li>No transpiler - This tutorial only need your browser and simple server such as live-server. If I encounter situation that I need a transpiling process, probably I use other Framework.</li>
    <li>Tag extension is .html - I know RiotJS recommends .riot as default tag extension, but this causes side effect such as text editor highlight or production web server MIME issue. This is one of point that I don't agree with main RiotJS community.</li>
    <li>ES6 - I stick with ES6, and I already mentioned that this book example might not be practical if you want to support all browsers. Most of browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are compatible with syntax that I use. I strongly discourage using ES5. If you are not familar with following keywoards, please clarify before proceed.
    <ul>
    <li>Arrow operator</li>
    <li>Class</li>
    <li>module system : import / export</li>
    <li>const</li>
    <li>find() and other ES6 functions</li>
    <li>async / await</li>
    <li>Spread ... operator</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
