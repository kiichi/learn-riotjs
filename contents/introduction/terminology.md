# Terminology

<ul>
    <li>Tag - A tag is nothing but component in RiotJS. You often hear I call tag as "component" or "page".</li>
    <li>State - When I specify something like "setting a state of this component", most likely it's about set a member variable of the component. RiotJS recommend to organize everything under .state property, so I'm following the practice.</li>
